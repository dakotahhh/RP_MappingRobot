Mapping Robot for RP
You have a robot capable of roaming the
streets in search of a destination, but it only has the ability to turn left or right and move forward any number of blocks; it
does not necessarily take the most direct route.
The robot stores data on each route including the date of the trip, the name of the destination, and a comma-separated list
of actions taken. Each action is comprised of a rotation (L – left, R – right) and a number of blocks.
Assumptions:
- The robot always starts facing West.
- The city spans an infinite number of blocks in every direction.
- The robot always reaches its destination.
